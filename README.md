>This is a repository storing my study in a graduate course in Distributed System, MIT 6.5840 Spring 2023. 

There are 4 labs in the course in which the core logic are provided and I need to implement the rest.

You can find the course and labs description [Here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html)

## Course Description

6.5840 is a core 12-unit graduate subject with lectures, readings, programming labs, an optional project, a mid-term exam, and a final exam. It will present abstractions and implementation techniques for engineering distributed systems. Major topics include fault tolerance, replication, and consistency. Much of the class consists of studying and discussing case studies of distributed systems.
