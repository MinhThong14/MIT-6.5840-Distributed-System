# MIT-6.5840-Distributed-System

>This is a repository storing my study in a graduate course in Distributed System, MIT 6.5840 Spring 2023. 

There are 4 labs in the course in which the core logic are provided and I need to implement the rest. The labs require me to have a fully understanding of course material including lectures and papers. There would be notes and documentations showing my works for each lab. 

You can find the course and labs description [Here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html)

## Course Description

6.5840 is a core 12-unit graduate subject with lectures, readings, programming labs, an optional project, a mid-term exam, and a final exam. It will present abstractions and implementation techniques for engineering distributed systems. Major topics include fault tolerance, replication, and consistency. Much of the class consists of studying and discussing case studies of distributed systems.

## Instruction to run code

There would be documentations covering the implemenation logic of each lab.
- Lab1: The code are in src/mr
  - cd ~/src/main
  - bash test-mr.sh

## Documents
- [Lab1]([https://github.com/MinhThong14/MIT-6.5840-Distributed-System.wiki.git](https://github.com/MinhThong14/MIT-6.5840-Distributed-System/wiki/Lab1))

## Acknowledgements

- I would like to thank [Prof. Robert Morris](http://nil.lcs.mit.edu/rtm/) and MIT for publicly launched the course for everyone

- To fully understand and implement the labs, I have learn from a variety of sources below:
  - Lab 1: thank you, [Nisarg Shah](https://github.com/nisarg1499/MIT-6.824-Labs) for showing your work in this lab.

## Contributions
- If you have another ideas on labs' implementation or figure out any bugs/erros on my works, please feel free to create a Pull Request. I'm happy to discuss and learn from yours.
